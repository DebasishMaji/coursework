# STATS-202

### Purpose:

  * Understand the distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning and be able to identify appropriate tools to answer different research questions.

   * Become familiar with basic unsupervised procedures including clustering and principal components analysis.

   * Become familiar with the following regression and classification algorithms: linear regression, ridge regression, the lasso, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbors, splines, generalized additive models, tree-based methods, and support vector machines.

   * Gain a practical appreciation of the bias-variance trade-off and apply model selection methods based on cross-validation and bootstrapping to a prediction challenge.

   * Analyze a real dataset of moderate size using python.

   * Develop the computational skills for data wrangling, collaboration, and reproducible research.

   * Be exposed to other topics in machine learning, such as missing data, prediction using time series and relational data, non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, web-based data visualizations, anomaly detection, and representation learning.
