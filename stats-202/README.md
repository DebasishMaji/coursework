# STATS-202

## Purpose:

  * ***Understand the distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning and be able to identify appropriate tools to answer different research questions.***

   * ***Become familiar with basic unsupervised procedures including clustering and principal components analysis.***

   * ***Become familiar with the following regression and classification algorithms: linear regression, ridge regression, the lasso, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbors, splines, generalized additive models, tree-based methods, and support vector machines.***

   * ***Gain a practical appreciation of the bias-variance tradeoff and apply model selection methods based on cross-validation and bootstrapping to a prediction challenge.***

   * ***Analyze a real dataset of moderate size using python.***

   * ***Develop the computational skills for data wrangling, collaboration, and reproducible research.***

   * ***Be exposed to other topics in machine learning, such as missing data, prediction using time series and relational data, non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, web-based data visualizations, anomaly detection, and representation learning.***
